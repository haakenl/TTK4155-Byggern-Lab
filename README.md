Graphical user interface (GUI).
SPI driver.
CANbus driver. (external MCP2515 CANcontroller is used for this.)
Node 2 (ATSAM3X8E) firmware contains:

USART driver and printf (code provided by NTNU).
CANbus driver (code provided by NTNU).
PWM driver.
PI-controller.
please feel free to use and learn from our mistakes in this project.
